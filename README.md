üëã  Hello!

I am a Software Engineer with 12 years of experience building web applications! Before joining [Elastic](https://elastic.co/), I worked for some of the top startups in the Americas, where I had fun while making significant contributions with my development and problem-solving skills. (Check my trajectory on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulohenriquesilva/" style="color: #0177CC"><b>LinkedIn</b></a>)

Currently, I'm focusing on FullStack development, and my primary goals are to work alongside product and design folks to shape features that will bring a huge impact on the organization while also achieving excellent **User** and  **Developer** Experiences.
